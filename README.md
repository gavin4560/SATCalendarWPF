# SATCalendarWPF

## Overview
This is an application completed in 2020 for a private client as part of my Year 12 VCE Software Development project.

It is a calendar/appointment management application written primarily in C#, and uses WPF for the GUI, as well as XML for storing information such as the user's reminders/appointments in databases.

## Features

 - **Appointments & Reminders:** an easy way for users to keep track of upcoming commitments.
 - **Daily tasks:** Through the use of a "roster" system, the user is able to keep track of tasks they need to complete during the day, as well as manage tasks for their family members, such as completing chores around the house.
 - **Multi-user support:** the login screen allows for more than one user to use the application, and store their own individual appointments and reminders.
 - **Editing of Appointments & Reminders:** If the user has made an error in their event, they are able to edit it through an easy to use GUI.
